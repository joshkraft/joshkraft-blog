    <p><b>My name is Josh Kraft</b>.</p>

    <p>I am a passionate generalist, currently interested in building scalable software solutions in the cloud. I work at <a href="https://www.ncino.com">nCino</a>, a leading fintech company built on the Salesforce platform. Previously, I was a Hollings Scholar with NOAA's <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov">Earth System Research Laboratories</a>, where I worked on geospatial modeling to predict the origin of high-ozone air masses.</p>

    <p>This blog is a place to collect my projects and thoughts relating to my current interests:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reproducibility in data projects</li>
        <li>Low cost, high performance machine learning systems</li>
        <li>Interpretability vs. Accuracy in deep learning algorithms</li>
    </ul>
