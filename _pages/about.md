    My name is Josh Kraft. I am a passionate generalist, currently interested in building scalable software solutions in the cloud. I currently work at <a href="https://www.ncino.com">nCino</a>, a leading fintech company built on the Salesforce platform.

    Previously, I was a Hollings Scholar with NOAA's <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov">Earth System Research Laboratories</a>, where I worked on geospatial modeling to predict the origin of high-ozone air masses.

    This blog is a place to collect my projects, thoughts, and ramblings on topics related to data and ML.
