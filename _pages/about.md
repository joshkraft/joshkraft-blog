**My name is Josh Kraft**. 

I am a passionate generalist, currently interested in building scalable software solutions in the cloud. I currently work at [nCino](https://www.ncino.com), a leading fintech company built on the Salesforce platform. Previously, I was a Hollings Scholar with NOAA's [Earth System Research Laboratories](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov), where I worked on geospatial modeling to predict the origin of high-ozone air masses.
