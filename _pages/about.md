    **My name is Josh Kraft**. 

    I am a passionate generalist, currently interested in building scalable software solutions in the cloud. I work at **[nCino](https://www.ncino.com)**, a leading fintech company built on the Salesforce platform. Previously, I was a Hollings Scholar with NOAA's **[Earth System Research Laboratories](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov)**, where I worked on geospatial modeling to predict the origin of high-ozone air masses. 

    This blog is a place to collect my projects and thoughts relating to my current interests:

    - Reproducibility in data science
    - Low cost, high performance machine learning systems
    - Interpretability vs. Accuracy in deep learning algorithms

    You can find more about my background on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshtkraft/)**, and my resume can be found **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPjd0Ydgf7HYkJ7bAt2_J0jOdcviuKXVbURgtfXkm08/edit?usp=sharing)**.
