> **Summary**
> In this blogpost, I will outline why **Github Actions can be useful for small-scale data collection projects**, by offering a free way to repeatedly run small data collection scripts in the cloud and push the data into a repository. Then, I will walk through how this tool can be used for **scraping Twitter data**, including how to **securely store API credentials** in Github.

## Motivation

A common starting point for any data-driven project is the search for good data. There are a few ways to go about gaining access to data:

| Option                            | Pros/Cons                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Buy a dataset from a vendor.      | High quality data, but is often very expensive.            |
| Use a publicly available dataset. | Free or cheap, but must wait for data to become available. |
| Generate your own dataset.        | Free or cheap, but requires effort.                        |

For many small-scale or exploratory projects, the first two options are often too expensive or too slow. If the data you are trying to collect is available on the web, there are a few free or cheap ways to go about collecting it: 

- **Data can be [scraped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping)**, by using tools to parse through the front end of a website. This is considered a *brute force* approach, and is often discouraged (or blocked entirely) by major websites.
- **Data can be requested via an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)**. This is considered the *elegant* approach, as the data is provided from the website in a structured format, though you will typically have to deal with limits placed on your requests.

Modern Python libraries such as [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org) have lowered the barrier to entry for generating datasets through scraping or accessing APIs. After a brief dive into the documentation, you can pretty reliably start gathering your own data for future use. 

However, oftentimes data needs to be gathered on a continuous basis. For example, a someone might be interested in gathering tweets about a certain topic on an hourly basis for analysis by stakeholders. The simplest approach would be to simply run the program on a laptop, hourly, and push the data into a repository somewhere. This is considered an [on-premises approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software) — the infrastructure for the project is supplied and maintained by the person that owns the laptop. This can be a great starting point for data projects, but the dependence on the availability of your laptop introduces an unnecessary liability into the system.

One way to eliminate this liability is to use a [cloud-based serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) platform like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/), which can be configured automatically run scripts and move the data for a fee. This platforms are very reliable, and are often the best choice for complex data projects.

However, recall that one of the allures of generating your own datasets is the fact that it can much cheaper than simply purchasing a dataset. AWS Lambda and Google Cloud functions are great platforms, but are often overkill for small scale projects. In this post, I will propose a workflow that leverages [**Github Actions**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) for small scale data collection projects, which <u>adds the benefits of cloud-based serverless computing without (necessarily) adding cost</u>.

> **Note**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Github Actions all have both free and paid tiers, and could fill this use case. However, my experience is that Github Actions are a better choice for small scale projects due to the generosity of the free tier, ease of use, and close integration with Github, where a project's code is typically already living.

## What are Github Actions?

Github Actions are a tool integrated into Github repositories, used to run small workloads on servers owned, operated, and maintained by Github. Here are a few of the most common use cases for Github Actions:

- Automatically run tests when new code is checked into a repository, before merging it into the overall codebase ([Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)).
- Automatically release new code to end users, typically after passing the suite of tests (**[Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)**).
- Scheduled jobs. For example, you might want to aggregate some metrics on changes in a repository and send it to relevant parties.

For more information about the capabilities (and limitations) of Github Actions, I would reccomend checking out the official [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/quickstart). 

In this case, we can use the scheduling capabilities of Github Actions to run our data collection script on a defined schedule, and let the Github servers handle the collection and moving of data. 

> **Note**: there are limitations to what Github Actions can be used for, especially while staying in the free tier. You should consult the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration) when deciding if this platform is right for your project. 

## An Example: Twitter Profile Scraper

As an example, I will walk through a simple data project I am currently working on. The overall goal of this project is to have an interesting visual way to see the tweets of the two main candidates in the 2020 US Presidential Election, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. 

The first step in this project is to start collecting the tweets in a repository for later use. Here are some constraints I decided upon for this project:

- Data must be grabbed from Twitter on a near-real time basis. Tweets from last month are much less relevant than tweets from the last hour.
- The data should be easily accessible to anyone. Due to the small amount of data in this project, we will just store it on Github for the sake of simplicity.
- Credentials should be securely stored in the cloud.
- The project should be completely free.

While Twitter does have a freely available API, there are some usage limits that you must adhere to. Due to the volume of data on the platform, you cannot make a request like this:

> Get all tweets from *User X*.

Instead, the following approach must be taken:

> Get a small number of tweets from *User X*, that meet certain conditions, that have occured *after Date Y* or *since the last tweet we retrieved from User X.*

Before beginning, you must gain access to the Twitter API by signing up for the [Twitter Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api). Once you have been accepted, create an Application with Read/Write access, and make sure to securely store your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secret. 

There are four main files that make this project work:

1. **scrape.py**: Python script performs the actual data collection.
2. **most_recent_tweet_id.json**: Stores the last retrieved Tweet ID for each user.
3. **workflow.yml**: YML file defining our main Github Action to run scrape.py.
4. **decrypt_secret.sh**: Shell script used to decrypt the API credentials.

### scrape.py

The main function of this script can be seen here:

```python
def main():
    api = authenticate_with_secrets('/home/runner/secrets/secrets.json')
    usernames = ["realDonaldTrump", "JoeBiden"]

    last_tweet_ids = get_last_tweet_ids()

    for user in usernames:
        file_path = "data/" + user + "/data.csv"
        processed_tweets = []
        tweets = get_tweets_from_user(api, user, last_tweet_ids)
        if tweets:
            for tweet in tweets:
                processed_tweet = process_raw_tweet(tweet)
                processed_tweets.append(processed_tweet)
            upload_tweets(processed_tweets, file_path)
    update_last_tweet_ids(last_tweet_ids)
```

This program can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Authenticate with Twitter API.**

   The following function is used to authenticate to the Twitter API, by opening a file containing API keys and then making a call to `tweepy.API()`:

   ```python
   import tweepy 
   
   def authenticate_with_secrets(secret_filepath):
       secret_file = open(secret_filepath)
       secret_data = json.load(secret_file)
       CONSUMER_KEY = secret_data["API_KEY"]
       CONSUMER_SECRET = secret_data["API_SECRET"]
       ACCESS_TOKEN = secret_data["ACCESS_TOKEN"]
       ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = secret_data["ACCESS_SECRET"]
       secret_file.close()
   
       auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
       auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
       api = tweepy.API(auth)
       
       return api
   ```

   

2. **Specify which accounts to collect tweets from.**

   This step is pretty self explanatory. I have opted to simply specify the Twitter accounts of interest as a list in our main function:

   ```python
   usernames = ["realDonaldTrump", "JoeBiden"]
   ```

   

3. **Fetch tweets, using existing data a starting point.**

   As mentioned before, there are limits on the Twitter API that we must adhere to. In order to avoid fetching unnecessary data, we will do the following:

   - Fetch a chunk of tweets from a user.

   - Grab the id of the most recent tweet in that chunk, and store it in a JSON file.
   - After some period of time, call the Twitter API referencing the above ID as a starting point. If there are new tweets, grab them. If not, move on.

   ```python
   def get_last_tweet_ids():
       with open("most_recent_tweet_id.json", "r") as file:
           return json.load(file)
           
   last_tweet_ids = get_last_tweet_ids()
   
   def get_tweets_from_user(api, user, last_tweet_ids):
       if user in last_tweet_ids:
           most_recent_tweet_id = int(last_tweet_ids[user])
           tweets = api.user_timeline(user, 
                                      since_id = most_recent_tweet_id + 1,
                                      include_rts = False,
                                      tweet_mode = 'extended')
       if tweets:
           last_tweet_ids[user] =  str(tweets[0].id)
           return tweets
       else:
           print('No tweets pulled for ' + user + '. Check recent tweet id.')
           
   tweets = get_tweets_from_user(api, user, last_tweet_ids)
   ```

4. **Proccess tweets, and then append them to a CSV file.**

   The following code is used to process the tweets, and write them to a file within our repository:

   ```python
   def process_raw_tweet(tweet):
       processed_tweet = {}
       processed_tweet['id'] = tweet.id
       processed_tweet['username'] = tweet.user.screen_name
       processed_tweet['tweet_text'] = tweet.full_text
       processed_tweet['retweets'] = tweet.retweet_count
       processed_tweet['location'] = tweet.user.location
       processed_tweet['created_at'] = tweet.created_at
       return processed_tweet
       
   def upload_tweets(tweets, file_path):
       df = pd.DataFrame(tweets)
       if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
           return df.to_csv(file_path)
       else: 
           return df.to_csv(file_path, mode='a', header=False)
           
   if tweets:
   	for tweet in tweets:
       processed_tweet = process_raw_tweet(tweet)
   		processed_tweets.append(processed_tweet)
     upload_tweets(processed_tweets, file_path)
   ```

5. **Update the 'last tweet ids' file.**

   The last step in the primary script is to update the `most_recent_tweet_id.json` file with the most recent tweet that we collected for each user:

   ```python
   def update_last_tweet_ids(last_tweet_ids):
       with open("most_recent_tweet_id.json", "w") as file:
           json.dump(last_tweet_ids, file)
           
   update_last_tweet_ids(last_tweet_ids)
   ```

   For reference, the `most_recent_tweet_id.json` file would look something like this:

   ```json
   {
     "realDonaldTrump": "1325067488695099397", 
     "JoeBiden": "1324926298762870785"
   }
   ```

To see the entire scrape.py file, you can see [the latest version here](https://github.com/joshkraft/daily-candidate-tweets/blob/main/scrape.py). At this point, we can see the overall functionality of the program. Two details remain: scheduling the program, and securely storing our credentials.

### workflow.yml

Scheduling our program to run is very easy with Github Actions. To begin, create a `.github` folder in the root folder of the project, and then create a folder called `workflows`within `.github`. Anything in this folder will be considered an Action by Github. Our directory has a file called `workflow.yml`, which I will walk through briefly here. I have added comments for clarity, as the syntax of this file may be unfamiliar.

First, we will set the schedule to run this action on an hourly cadence:

```yaml
# Name of the workflow.
name: Fetch New Tweets

# Event that triggers workflow.
on:
  schedule:
  	# How often to run the workflow.
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
```

Next, we need to define our 'job', giving it a name and stating what type of machine it should run on:

```yaml
jobs:
  collect-data-job:
    name: Fetch New Tweets
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
```

The rest of `workflow.yml` consists of defining small steps to define the actions we want this machine to perform:

```yaml
		steps:
			# Checkout a fresh version of the project.
      - name: Checkout Repository.
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

```yaml
      # Configure Python. 
      - name: Setup Python 3.7.
              uses: actions/setup-python@v2
              with:
                python-version: '3.7'
```

```yaml
      # Decrypt our API credentials. 
      - name: Decrypt Secrets file.
              run: ./.github/scripts/decrypt_secret.sh
              env:
                SECRET_PASSPHRASE: ${{ secrets.SECRET_PASSPHRASE }}
```

```yaml
      # Install needed packages, and run scrape.py, passing in API credentials. 
      - name: Install dependencies and run script.
              run: |
                python -m pip install --upgrade pip
                pip install -r requirements.txt
                python scrape.py
              env:
                CONSUMER_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONSUMER_KEY }}
                CONSUMER_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CONSUMER_SECRET }}
                ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
                ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
```

```yaml
      # If any new data was fetched, create a new commit to the repo. 
      - name: Commit data to repo.
              run: |
                git config --global user.email "joshkraft757@gmail.com"
                git config --global user.name "Josh Kraft"
                git add -A
                timestamp=$(date -u)
                git commit -m "Latest data: ${timestamp}" || exit 0
                git push
```

### decrypt_secret.sh

In Step 3 above, we reference a file called `decrypt_secret.sh`. So far as I can tell, this is the best workflow for securely accessing API credentials (or any credentials for that matter) from a Github Action:

1. Store your credentials in a file, locally. For example, this project originally had a file like this, `secrets.json`:

   ```json
   {
       "API_KEY": "KSMdwErGfjr4T5G25vDtE4o1u",
       "API_SECRET": "khfQottTJZQ3zwsgj12ltDj2Ycn5DZnmnhxQy46vNp12dIshF7",
       "ACCESS_TOKEN": "980953835723280384-KDkJsMR7OwS2sdffMxeEk4BLlzghUPT",
       "ACCESS_SECRET": "LcU62QbxfvTsnp675829eTvfmRaI0VuG2TNtAHN6tcizJ"
   }
   ```

2. Run the following command in a terminal to encrypt the file using `gpg`:

   ```bash
   $ gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 secrets.json
   ```

   You will need to supply a password at this point.

3. Notice that you now have a file named `secrets.json.gpg`. This is the encrypted file, and can only be decrypted with the password. Add this to your project, and push it to Github. **Note:** be sure not to accidentally push your unencrypted `secrets.json` to Github as well!

4. Head over to Github and create a Secret named SECRET_PASSPHRASE. Enter the password from Step 2.

5. Now, go ahead and create the `decrypt_secret.sh`file in `.github/scripts/`. The contents of my file look like this:

   ```shell
   # Decrypt the file
   mkdir $HOME/secrets
   echo $HOME
   gpg --quiet --batch --yes --decrypt --passphrase="$SECRET_PASSPHRASE" \
   --output $HOME/secrets/secrets.json secrets.json.gpg
   ```

   The last line is the important - we are saying to decrypt our  `secrets.json.gpg` file, using the `SECRET_PASSPHRASE` stored in Github, and then output it to a file called `secrets.json`on the virtual machine that gets utilized when our workflow is run.

   > Note: you might recoginize this as the filepath we passed in to our `authenticate_with_secrets()` function earlier: 
   >
   > **/home/runner/secrets/secrets.json**
   >
   > If you change the instructions in your shell file, be sure to pass the right path in to your authentication function.  

## Conclusion

In this post, I explained why Github Actions can be a useful tool for small-scale data collection projects. If your goals are to collect small amounts of data, on a regular basis, there are not many other cloud options that can compete with the simplicity and low cost of Github Actions.
