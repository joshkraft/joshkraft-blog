# AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certification Resources

------

## Overview

I recently passed the [**AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty**](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/) exam. Given the relative newness of this exam (released in March 2019), I found it difficult to come across quality resources around what sort of topics are tested on the exam, as well as the depth to which each topic is covered. In this post, I hope to provide a road-map for others that are studying for this exam. 

On the [**certification homepage**](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/), AWS gives the following description of the exam:

> *The AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty certification is intended for individuals who perform a development or data science role. It validates a candidate's ability to design, implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning (ML) solutions for given business problems.*
>
> **Abilities Validated by the Certification**
>
> - Select and justify the appropriate ML approach for a given business problem
> - Identify appropriate AWS services to implement ML solutions
> - Design and implement scalable, cost-optimized, reliable, and secure ML solutions
>
> ***Recommended Knowledge and Experience***
>
> - 1-2 years of experience developing, architecting, or running ML/deep learning workloads on the AWS Cloud
>
> - The ability to express the intuition behind basic ML algorithms
>
> - Experience performing basic hyperparameter optimization
>
> - Experience with ML and deep learning frameworks
>
> - The ability to follow model-training best practices
>
> - The ability to follow deployment and operational best practices



While I think that this does provide a good overview of the certification, I believe that the best way to study for this exam, assuming minimal experience in ML and AWS, is to break your learning up into 4 stages:

1. Become proficient(ish) in Python.
2. Study ML until you can explain the core concepts/algorithms to a friend.
3. Learn the AWS services/algorithms relevant to this exam.
4. Read up on Machine Learning Engineering concepts.

## 1. Become proficient(ish) in Python.

Speaking broadly, the two ways to build intuition around ML concepts is through reading mathematical formulas (theory), or implementations in code (application). For the vast majority of people looking to enter the field of ML, learning to code (and read code) first is a great option, as it will allow you to start experimenting on your own. Then, you can pick up on the math as it becomes necessary along the way.

Currently, Python is the go-to language for most machine learning practitioners and libraries, so the resources that you come across when studying ML will likely be written in Python. Luckily, Python has a relatively short learning curve, and can be used to do just about anything. There are a plethora of Python resources available for free on the internet, but my favorite starting point is the [**Kaggle Python Course**](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python), taught by [**Colin Morris**](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris).

## 2. Study ML until you can explain the core concepts/algorithms to a friend.

Once you are comfortable with the basics of Python, it is time to move on to the main focus of the exam: machine learning. The material covered in this step makes up about 50% of the exam, and can be unintuitive for those with no background in math or statistics. However, the concepts all build on each other, and the more time you spend experimenting the easier it will be to understand the relevant concepts. In no particular order, here are the ML resources I found most useful:

**Machine Learning Guide (Podcast)**
I found this podcast to be a phenomenal introduction to the ML field, and the creator is very intentional about providing the ‘forest for the trees’, providing context for how all the different pieces of ML go together. The podcast starts at the very basics of the field, with topics like Linear and Logistic Regression, which are crucial algorithms to understand before jumping off into the deep end.

**FastAI (Course/Book)**
I am a huge fan of everything **FastAI** puts out, and I found the latest version of their **Practical Deep Learning for Coders** to be both informative and motivating. This course is completely focused on practical applications of Deep Learning:

> We teach almost everything through real examples. As we build out those examples, we go deeper and deeper, and we'll show you how to make your projects better and better. This means that you'll be gradually learning all the theoretical foundations you need, in context, in such a way that you'll see why it matters and how it works.

This course leaves you with a good understanding of what Deep Learning is, why it is so useful, and how to apply Deep Learning to real-world problems. I recommend taking your time with this course - the more you put in, the more you will get out.

**Deep Learning with Python (Book)**
Another resource I found useful was **Francois Chollets** Deep Learning with Python book. PICK UP HERE!

**Neural Networks from Scratch (Book)**

**Other useful resources:**Lex Fridman Podcast:Applied Data Ethics:3Blue1Brown
