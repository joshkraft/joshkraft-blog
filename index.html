My name is Josh Kraft. I am a passionate generalist, currently interested in
building scalable software solutions in the cloud. I currently work at
[nCino](https://www.ncino.com), a leading fintech company built on the
Salesforce platform. In my role as a Support Engineer, I troubleshoot technical
issues, advise on change management, and develop solutions to optimize business
processes. Previously, I was a Hollings Scholar with NOAA's [Earth System
Research Laboratories](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov), where I worked on geospatial
modeling to predict the origin of high-ozone air masses. # Posts
