        # About Me
        I am a passionate generalist, currently interested in the intersection of ML and software engineering. I hold a number of certifications, including the **[AWS Machine Learning Speciality](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty)** and **[Salesforce Platform Developer II](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/help?article=Salesforce-Certified-Platform-Developer-II-Exam-Guide)**.

Previously, I was a Hollings Scholar with NOAA's **[Earth Systems Research Laboratory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov)**, where I worked on geospatial modeling of air masses.
