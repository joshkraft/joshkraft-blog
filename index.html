# About Me
I am a passionate generalist, currently interested in the intersection of ML and software engineering. I hold a number of certifications, including the **[AWS Machine Learning Speciality](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty)** and **[Salesforce Platform Developer II](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/help?article=Salesforce-Certified-Platform-Developer-II-Exam-Guide)**.

I lead a team of Support Engineers at **[nCino](https://www.ncino.com)**, a leading fintech company built on Salesforce. Previously, I was a Hollings Scholar with NOAA's **[Earth Systems Research Laboratory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov)**, where I worked on geospatial modeling of air masses.

You can find more about my background on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshtkraft/)**, and you can find my resume **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I65R9kv9rE_HA8f11GQE8xFqUSRiTM0t/view)**.
